# An analysis of kickstarter campaigns

## Overview
Lousie needs to raise $10,000 to produce her play Fever. This is an analysis of kickstarter campaigns to guide Louise on what characteristics a successful campaign has. Included is an analysis of campaigns based on goal size and an analysis of campaigns by launch date.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis

I performed the analysis by creating pivot tables and charts on the kickstarter data set. I utilized the vlookup and countifs functions to get required data into the right locations in order to make the pivot tables.

### Challenges

I had some trouble with the countifs function. I had forgot the "" around the text in the formula. This took me a little while to trouble shoot and before correcting it.

## Results

### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date

The summer is the best time to launch a kickstarter campaign with May, June and July having the most successful campaigns. May was the best month overall.

December is the worst month to start a campaign, there were almost as many failed campaigns as there were successful.
